# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
X Education, a leader in providing online courses to industry professionals, draws numerous leads through its website, marketing campaigns, and referrals. Despite this, the current lead conversion rate is only about 30%, which is suboptimal for the companyâ€™s growth ambitions.

Challenge: To significantly boost their conversion rate to the target of 80%, X Education needs a sophisticated solution that accurately identifies and prioritizes high-potential leads,
thereby optimizing the follow-up process and reducing efforts on low-probability prospects.

Objective: Develop an advanced Machine Learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of each lead converting into a customer. This model will enable the sales team to
focus their efforts strategically on leads with the highest potential, enhancing efficiency and driving up the conversion rate.
